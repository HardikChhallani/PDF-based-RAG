The Munda \\nlanguage family includes Santali. \\n   \\n  Except for the Khasian languages spoken in Meghalaya, northeastern India, and the \\nNicobarese languages spoken in the Nicobar Islands in the Andaman Sea, just to the \\nnorthwest of the Indonesian island of Sumatra —both of which are classified as part \\nof the Mon-Khmer subfamily of Austroasiatic —the other Austronesian languages \\nare spoken in Southeast Asia. \\n  The Indo-Aryan languages, which are spoken by 78.05 percent of Indians, belong to \\nmultiple linguistic families. \\n   \\n  Dravidian languages are spoken by 19.64% of Indians, and both groups are \\nfrequently referred to as Indic languages.  \\n \\n   \\n  The remaining 2.31 percent of the population speaks Austroasiatic, Sino –Tibetan, \\nand Tai –Kadai languages. \\n  According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 \\nother languages. \\n   \\n  India has 22 major languages with approximately 720 dialects written in 13 distinct \\nscripts.  \\n \\n  The official languages of India are Hindi which has 420 million speakers and \\nEnglish which is also widely spoken.  \\n \\n  The census of 2011 acknowledges 1369 rationalised mother tongues and 1474 \\nnames that were handled as 'unclassified' and consigned to the 'other' mother tongue \\ncategory out of 19,569 raw linguistic connections.\", metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction to Literature \\n \\n \\nLiterature is a broad term that refers to any collection of written material, but it is also \\nused to refer to writings that are considered to be art forms, such as prose fiction, \\ndrama, and poetry. \\n \\nThe term has broadened in recent decades to include oral literature, most of which has \\nbeen transcribed. \\nLiterature can have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political purpose in addition \\nto recording, preserving, and transferring knowledge and amusement. \\n \\nNonfiction genres such as biography, diaries, memoir, correspondence, and the essay \\ncan all be considered part of literature as an art form. \\n \\nNonfictional books, articles, and other printed information on a particular subject are \\nincluded in the broad definition of literature. \\n \\nThe name comes from the Latin literatura/litteratura, which means \"learning, writing, \\ngrammar,\" and was originally \"writing produced with letters,\" from litera/littera, \\nwhich means \"letter.\" \\nIn spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. \\n \\nPrint technological advancements have enabled an ever-increasing diffusion and \\nproliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature. \\n \\nLiterature helps us to travel through time and learn about life on the planet from those \\nwho came before us.  \\n \\nIt can have a deeper understanding of and appreciation for different cultures. It can \\nhelp us to learn about history through the ways it is documented, such as manuscripts \\nand oral history. \\n \\nLiterature serves as an enormous information base.  \\nGreat inventors\\' research papers and literary works by famous scientists frequently tell \\nanecdotes about their significant discoveries and inferences. \\n \\nCurrent scientific and technological developments are chronicled so that the rest of \\nthe world is aware of them. \\n \\nSeveral ancient scriptures presenting accounts of human evolution and narratives of \\nhuman life in those times have proven to be extremely beneficial to humanity.  \\n \\nAs a result, literature has always been a reliable source of information.  \\n \\nSanskrit \\nSanskrit is considered the oldest language in Hinduism, having been used by the \\nHindu Celestial Gods for communication and dialogue, and then by the Indo-Aryans.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, Sanskrit is commonly used. The title \\'Sanskrit\\' \\ncomes from the combination of the prefix \\'Sam\\' meaning \\'samyak,\\' which means \\n\\'completely,\\' and \\'krit,\\' which means \\'done.\\'  \\nThus, the name denotes communicating, reading, listening, and the use of vocabulary \\nto transcend and communicate an emotion that is totally or entirely done. \\n \\nDespite being an extremely complicated language with a large vocabulary, it is still \\nfrequently used in the reading of sacred books and hymns today \\n \\nIn Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, the Sanskrit language has long been \\nthe primary medium of communication.  \\n \\nSanskrit literature has a long history of use in ancient poetry, drama, science, and \\nreligious and philosophical books. \\n  \\nLet ’s now look at the role of Sanskrit. \\nMany Indian languages have their roots in Sanskrit. Sanskrit is used to write the \\nVedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and Dharmasutras.  \\n \\nA wide range of secular and regional literature is also available. We will be able to \\nbetter comprehend our civilization and appreciate the diversity and complexity of our \\nculture by reading about the languages and literature developed in the past.  \\n \\nOur country\\'s most ancient language is Sanskrit. It is one of the Indian Constitution\\'s \\ntwenty-two official languages. \\n \\nSanskrit is maybe the only language that has crossed geographical and cultural \\nboundaries.  \\nThere is no portion of India that has not contributed to or been touched by this \\nlanguage, from north to south and east to west. \\n \\nKalidasa\\'s writings have added to the treasury of Sanskrit writings\\' beauty. \\n \\nSignificance of Scriptures to the Current Society \\n \\nScriptures from the Latin Scriptura, which means \"writing\" are sacred texts that serve \\na range of roles in a religious tradition\\'s individual and collective existence.  \\nScriptures can be utilised to generate a deeper relationship with the divine, \\ncommunicate spiritual truths, foster collective identity, and guide individual and \\ncommunal spiritual practice. \\n \\nThe study of Scripture has become an intellectual pursuit in modern times. \\n \\nSacred texts from different civilizations are increasingly being studied in academic \\nsettings, mostly to improve understanding of other cultures, whether ancient or \\nmodern.  \\n \\nEven for casual readers, the easy accessibility to scriptures from all faith traditions has \\naided mutual understanding and appreciation for the importance of all religions.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Spiritual searchers of all faiths can discover guidance throughout the world's \\nscriptures to help them on their way. \\n  Scripture plays a range of aspects in a religious community's spiritual life.  \\n   \\nIn a religion, scripture serves three purposes: personal direction and inspiration, \\ncollective  \\n  worship and instruction, and bibliomancy using scripture for magical purposes. \\n \\n  For many years, restricted literacy and crude copying methods impeded the general \\ncirculation of religious books, but scripture has always had a personal dimension —at \\nleast for those who have access to it.  \\n \\n  With the advancement of literacy and the invention of printing and \\ntelecommunications, many people can now personally encounter the scriptures from \\ntheir own faiths. \\n \\nThe Internet, television, and computers have altered the way and frequency with \\nwhich information, especially scriptures, is shared.  \\n   \\n  Most religious books and masterpieces from throughout the world have been archived \\nelectronically on the Internet and are available to read in a variety of languages. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nLanguage is what allows people to express things, thoughts, and attitudes in a \\ncomprehensible manner and to communicate the results to others. \\n \\nIndia has always been a country with many different countries and languages.

This is totally a period of creation of pure literature \\nwhich is evident in works such as Mahakavyas ( epics ) and Khandakavyas (semi -epics).In \\nthe field of Sanskrit literature,  The Gupta period is known as the period of unique creation \\nbecause a variety of literary works developed during this reign. Another important aspect of it \\nis related to the ornate style in literary works. Many of the plays developed during the Gupta \\nperiod were also written in Sanskrit. However, it is to be noted that one of the features of \\nthese plays was the use of Sanskrit language by the characters of high varna and the use of \\nPrakrit language by women and Shudras.  \\nClassical Sanskrit Literature  \\n• Most of the literature in Sanskrit has been divided into the Vedic and Classical \\ncategories.  \\n• The two epics: Mahabharata and Ramayana are also part of the classical category. \\nIrrespective of their centrality to the Hindu religion, these epics can also be \\nconsidered to be the pre -cursors of Sanskrit Kavya ( epic poetry ), nataka ( classical \\ndrama ), and other treatises on medicine, statecraft, grammar, astronomy, \\nmathematics, etc.  \\n• Most of this Sanskrit literature was bound by the rules of grammar that have been \\nexplained brilliantly in Panini’s Ashtadhyayi, a treatise on the rigid rules which bind \\nthe Sanskrit language.  \\nAshtadhyayi:  \\n• The only surviving foundational and analytical  source of Sanskrit grammar , \\nAshtadhyayi (literally, “eight chapters”), was written by  Panini  and is believed to \\nhave been published in the 4th century BCE.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The last academy is credited with the corpus of \\nliterature now known as ‘Sangam Works  \\nLet ’s see the ancient and famous literatures of South India, starting with Tolkappiyam \\n• Tolkappiyam, the name signifying the ancient book or ‘the preserver of ancient \\ninstitutions ’, was written by Tolkappiyanar and is the oldest extant Tamil grammar \\ndating back to 500 B.C.  \\n• It lays down rules for different kinds of poetical compositions drawn from the \\nexamples furnished by the best works available at that time. \\n•  Iyal is elucidated clearly and systematically in Tolkappiyam.  \\n• Containing about 1,610 suttirams (aphorisms), it is in three parts-ezhuttu \\n(orthography), Sol (etymology), and porul (literary conventions and usages)-each with \\nnine sections.  \\n• While the first two parts are interesting from both linguistic and philological points of \\nview, the third, poruladhikdram, is most valuable as it gives a glimpse of the political, \\nsocial, and religious life of the people during the period when the author of this \\ntreatise lived.  \\n• The principal works of the third Sangam have come down to us in the shape of \\nanthologies of poems. The two compilations forming the corpus of the poetry of the \\nthird Sangam are Ettuttogai (eight anthologies) and Pattuppattu (ten idylls), \\n• The anthologies of the third Sangam consist of poems divided into two broad \\ncategories-aham or interior and puram or exterior. The former concerns all phases of \\nlove between men and women. An allegory of the different stages through which the \\nsoul of man passes from its manifestation in the body to its final unification with the \\nSupreme Being is seen in aham. The puram covers varieties of distinctive poems, \\nmostly relating to man ’s social behaviour. \\n• corresponding to five major regions of Tamil Nadu, these poems describe five types \\nof tracts with their distinctive features. These are: kurinci (mountainous region), \\nmullai (forest region), marutam (agricultural region), neytal (coastal region), and', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"pallai (desert region). True love, which is either karpu (wedded) or kalavu (furtive), is \\nconsidered under five aspects, namely, punartal (union), pirital (separation), irutal \\n(patience in separation), irangal (bewailing), and udal (sulking), and these are made to \\ncorrelate with tinai, the fivefold physiographical divisions. \\n• The delineation of the early Tamil society in these poems is remarkably clear and a \\ngreat deal of light is thrown on the civilization of the Tamils. \\n• Sangam works provide us with valuable information regarding religion, social life, \\ngovernment, commerce, arts, music, dance, courtship, manners and customs, and the \\ndaily life of the Tamils. \\nOne another notable piece of work by Tiruvalluvar ’s '(c. first century B.C.) is \\nTirukkural or Kural, \\n• Tirukkural which is in the form of couplets and deals with the three aims of life-aram \\n(righteousness), porul (wealth), and inbam or kamam (pleasure). \\n• It consists of 133 chapters each containing ten couplets. Conveying noble thoughts \\ncouched in concised language, each couplet is a gem by itself. The first part of Kural \\n(arattuppal) gives the essentials of Yoga philosophy. Besides, it deals with the happy \\nhousehold life as well as guiding towards the path of renunciation. The thoughts of \\nKural in its second part (porutpal) centre on polity and administration, including \\ncitizenship and social relations, in an admirable way. The third part (inbattuppal or \\nkamattuppal), consisting of couplets in dramatic monologues, treats of the concept of \\nlove. \\nPost-Sangam period: The Epics \\n• The five major epics-Silappadikaram, Manimekalai, Jivaka-cintamani, Valaiyapati, \\nand Kundalakesi-are the outstanding contributions of the post-Sangam period. \\n• In this session we will explore two of the ‘Five Great Jewels ’ of Tamil literature: The \\nLay of the Anklet (Cilappatikāram) and The Dancer with the Magic Bowl \\n(Maṇimēkalai). These epics were composed sometime between the 1st and 8th \\ncenturies CE and present a view of the societies, religions, and cultures of ancient \\nSouth India. The central narratives of both epics follow the adventures of female \\nprotagonists: Ka ṇṇaki, a devoted wife turned goddess, and Ma ṇimēkalai, a dancer -\\ncourtesan turned renunciant.  \\n• These two epics are also connected through their female characters, as Ma ṇimēkalai is \\nthe daughter of Ka ṇṇaki’s husband Kōvalaṉ  and his mistress Mātavi. In conjunction \\nwith reading these fascinating tales, we will also explore their literary and historical \\ncontexts and their significance within the Jain and Buddhist religious traditions. \\n• Silappadikaram - contains all the three aspects of Tamil literature, viz. iyal, isai, and \\nnatakam, it has been designated as a muttamizhk-kappiyam. It is, therefore, invaluable \\nas a source-book of ancient Tamil dance and classical music-both vocal and \\ninstrumental. The author of this work is the ascetic-poet Ilanko Adikal. \\n• Manimekalai, a direct sequel to Silappadikaram, is also a great source of information \\non ancient Tamil society.

       " Document(page_content='Tamil Literature \\nTamil literature goes back to the Sangam Era , named after the assembly (sangam) of poets. \\nSangam Period \\n• The period roughly between the 3rd century B.C. and 3rd century A.D. in South India \\n(the area lying to the south of river Krishna and Tungabhadra) is known as Sangam \\nPeriod. \\n• It has been named after the Sangam academies held during that period that flourished \\nunder the royal patronage of the Pandya kings of Madurai. \\n• At the sangams, eminent scholars assembled and functioned as the board of censors \\nand the choicest literature was rendered in the nature of anthologies. \\n• These literary works were the earliest specimens of Dravidian literature. \\n• South India, during the Sangam Age, was ruled by three dynasties-the Cheras, \\nCholas and Pandyas. \\nThree Sangams \\nAccording to the Tamil legends, there were three Sangams (Academy of Tamil poets) held in \\nthe ancient South India popularly called Muchchangam. \\n• The First Sangam, is believed to be held at Madurai, attended by gods and legendary \\nsages. No literary work of this Sangam is available. \\n• The Second Sangam was held at Kapadapuram, only Tolkappiyam survives from this. \\n• The Third Sangam was also held at Madurai. A few of these Tamil literary works \\nhave survived and are a useful source to reconstruct the history of the Sangam period. \\nSangam Literature \\nThe Sangam literature includes Tolkappiyam, Ettutogai, Pattuppattu, Pathinenkilkanakku, \\nand two epics named – Silappathikaram and Manimegalai. \\n• Tolkappiyam:  It was authored by Tolkappiyar and is considered the earliest of Tamil \\nliterary work. \\n• Though it is a work on Tamil grammar, it also provides insights on the \\npolitical and socio-economic conditions of the time. \\n• It is a unique work on grammar and poetics, in its three parts of nine sections \\neach, deals with Ezhuttu(letter), Col (word) and Porul (subject matter). \\n• Almost all levels of the human language from the spoken to the most poetic lie \\nwithin the purview of Tolkappiyar ’s analysis as he treats in exquisitely poetic \\nand epigrammatic statements on phonology, morphology, syntax, rhetoric, \\nprosody and poetics. \\n• Ettutogai (Eight Anthologies):  It consists of eight works – Aingurunooru, Narrinai, \\nAganaooru, Purananooru, Kuruntogai, Kalittogai, Paripadal and Padirruppatu.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Pattuppattu (Ten Idylls) : It consists of ten work s – Thirumurugarruppadai, \\nPorunararruppadai, Sirupanarruppadai, Perumpanarruppadai, Mullaippattu, \\nNedunalvadai, Maduraikkanji, Kurinjippatttu,Pattinappalai and Malaipadukadam. \\n• Pathinenkilkanakku : It contains eighteen works about ethics and morals. \\n• The most important among these works is Tirukkural authored \\nby Thiruvalluvar,  the tamil great poet and philosopher. \\n• Tamil Epics:  The two epics Silappathikaram  is written by Elango \\nAdigal  and Manimegalai  by Sittalai Sattanar.  \\n• They also provide valuable details about the Sangam society and polity. \\nMedieval Tamil literature \\n• The medieval period, spanning from the 11th and 13th centuries, was one of harmony \\namongst Tamil people. Avvaiyar, a female poet whose name translates to ‘respectable \\nwoman ’, created poems during this era that continue to be taught in Tamil schools \\ntoday. Avvaiyar is one of the most crucial poets of Tamil history, as her poems appeal \\nto children. Her well-known poem, Aathichoodi, demonstrates to children how to live \\na life full of moral genuineness with the use of the Tamil alphabet. \\nVijayanagar and Nayak period \\n• The Vijayanagar and Nayak period, reigning from approximately 1300 to 1650 C.E., \\nwas a period in Tamil history where the Tamil country would be affected by an \\ninvasion, and ultimately conquered. As a result, the rise of the Vijayanagar kingdom \\nand Nayak governance came about. Exemplary works in Tamil literature were still \\nproduced in this era. For example, Thiruppugazh by Arunagirinathar. \\nThiruppugazh \\n• Thiruppugazh, created in the 15th century, is a work of religious songs praising Lord \\nMurugan. The background behind Arunagirinathar ’s reason for \\nwriting Thiruppugazh is quite intriguing. According to Arunagirinathar, Lord \\nMurugan saved him when he was going to end his life at a temple. Ultimately, this \\nreformed his life. Consequently, Arunagirinathar decides to make devotional songs to \\nthank Lord Murugan for saving him. \\n• This period demonstrated the devotionality to religion prominently, especially with \\nthe use of literature. As seen throughout this article, the Hindu religion is prominently \\nvalued among Tamil people. \\nThe modern era of Tamil literature \\n• The late 18th to 19th centuries brought the Modern era in Tamil literature. This gave \\nus the works of Subramanya Bharathi, who was a writer and an important member in \\nterms of social reform. Bharathi was very influential, both with his literature and \\nactivism. \\n• Bharathi ’s work is often cited as the inspiration for modern Tamil literature. His work \\nis said to involve both modernist and classical techniques. Additionally, his poems', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='show how outspoken he was about social issues, and often display rebellious remarks. \\nBharathi covered a variety of topics in his works, from children ’s songs to praising \\nthose fighting for India ’s independence. \\n Here is Bharathi ’s commentary on the Indian caste system: \\n  There is no caste system. \\n  It is a sin to divide people on caste basis. \\n  The ones who are really of a superior class are the ones \\n  excelling in being just, wise, educated and loving. \\nThe rise of Tamil novels \\n• The modern era of Tamil literature was accompanied by a rise in novels. \\nRamanichandaran would contribute to this rising trend with the composition of \\nmodern romance novels in the 20th century. She is currently the best-selling author in \\nTamil literature, with 178 novels written. \\n• Ramanichandran ’s focus on romance novels does not include the idea of caste \\nsystems, which is a common controversy within South Asia because the caste system \\nis still used to this day. \\n• One of her famous books, Kanney Kanmaniey, illustrates Madura and her lover, \\nSathyan. Madura ’s brother loses money while betting on horses, causing her and her \\nbrother to work at Sathyan ’s hotel. Sathyan unknowingly believes that Madura \\nbetrayed him and ends up marrying another woman, but his wife ends up dying. \\nConflicted with revenge and undying love, Sathyan is confused about how to act \\ntowards Madura. In sum, the story follows Sathyan ’s journey of love and figuring out \\nhis feelings towards Madura. \\n• As a result, these types of stories are very popular among Tamil women because it \\nallows them to live through these stories. \\nCultural and linguistic significance in anthropology \\n• Tamil, being one of the oldest recorded languages in linguistic history, has a diverse \\nlibrary of literature. With commentaries on ethics and struggles, to songs depicting the \\nbeauty of nature before the rise of demolition of the environment, Tamil literature \\ngives us a deep insight into the values of  South Asian culture. \\n• Some of these values are still appraised today. In retrospect, the Tamil people were \\nseemingly advanced in terms of thought and transcribing it into literature.  \\n• The exploration of this language allows for a better understanding of the Tamil \\nculture and its customs.  \\n• In addition, there is linguistic significance when looking at the history of Tamil \\nliterature as well. Though most, if not all, literature from the 6th Century BCE does \\nnot remain today, it is still evident that the Tamil people took time to record their \\nthoughts.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='OTHER INDIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE  \\nIntroduction  \\nRichness of any culture can been seen and appreciated but when it comes to language and \\nliterature it is to be read and heard. We have to appreciate and take pride in this particular \\naspect of our culture. We must make it a point to read as many books written during those \\ntimes as it will help us to understand so many things that happened in those times. It will help \\nus to read more books and become familiar with so many things that our happening around us \\ntoday.  \\nNORTHERN INDIAN LANGUAGES & LITERATURE  \\nWe have already seen how languages evolved in India right upto the early medieval period. \\nThe old apabhramsha had taken new forms in some areas or was in the process of evolving \\ninto other forms. These languages were evolving at two levels: the spoken and the written \\nlanguage. The old Brahmi script of the Ashoka days had undergone a great change. The \\nalphabets during Ashoka’s period were uneven in size but by the time of Harsha, the letters \\nhad become of the same size and were regular, presenting the picture of a cultivated hand The \\nstudies have indicated that all the scripts of present northern Indian languages, except that of \\nUrdu, have had their origin in old Brahmi. A long and slow process had given them this \\nshape. If we compare the scripts of Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi, we can easily understand this \\nchange. As for the spoken word, there are over 200 languages or dialects spoken in India at \\npresent. Some are widely used while others are limited to a particular area. Out of all these, \\nonly twenty -two have found their way into our Constitution.  A large number of people speak \\nHindi in its different forms that include Braj Bhasha, and Avadhi (spoken in Oudh region), \\nBhojpuri, Magadhi, and Maithili (spoken around Mithila), and Rajasthani and Khadi Boli \\n(spoken around Delhi). Rajasthani is another variant or dialect of Hindi. This classification \\nhas been made on the basis of literature produced by great poets over a length of time. Thus, \\nthe language used by Surdas and Bihari has been given the name of Braj Bhasha; that used by \\nTulsidas in the Ramacharitamanasa is called Avadhi and the one used by Vidyapati has been \\ntermed as Maithili. But Hindi, as we know it today is the one called Khadi Boli. Though \\nKhusrau has used Khadi Boli in his compositions in the thirteenth century its extensive use in \\nliterature began only in the nineteenth century. It even shows some influence of Urdu.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PERSIAN AND URDU  \\nUrdu emerged as an independent language towards the end of the 4th century AD. Arabic and \\nPersian were introduced in India with the coming of the Turks and the Mongols. Persian \\nremained the court language for many centuries. Urdu as a language was born out of the \\ninteraction between Hindi and Persian. After the conquest of Delhi (1192), the Turkish people \\nsettled in this region. Urdu was born out of the interaction of these settlers and soldiers in the \\nbarracks with the common people. Originally it was a dialect but slowly it acquired all the \\nfeatures of a formal language when the authors started using Persian script. It was further \\ngiven an impetus by its use in Bahamani states of Ahmadnagar, Golkunda, Bijapur and Berar. \\nHere it was even called dakshini or daccani (southern). As time passed, it became popular \\nwith the masses of Delhi.Urdu became more popular in the early eighteenth century. People \\neven wrote accounts of later Mughals in Urdu. Gradually it achieved a status where literature -\\nboth poetry and prose -started being composed in it. The last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah \\nZafar wrote poetry in it. Some of his couplets have become quite well known in the Hindi and \\nUrdu speaking areas. Urdu was given its pride of place by a large number of poets who have \\nleft inimitable poetry for posterity. The earliest Urdu poet is supposed to be Khusrau (1253 -\\n1325). He started writing as a poet in the reign of Sultan Balban and was a follower of Nizam \\nud-din Auliya. He is said to have composed ninty -nine works on separate themes and \\nnumerous verses of poetry. Among the important works composed by him are Laila Majnun \\nand Ayina -I-Sikandari dedicated to Alau -din-Khalji. Among other well -known poets are \\nGhalib, Zauq, and Iqbal. Iqbal’s Urdu poetry is available in his collection called Bang - i - \\ndara. His Sarejahan se achcha Hindostan hamara is sung and played at many of the national \\ncelebrations in India. No army parade is considered complete without the army band playing \\nthis tune. In big Indian cities like Delhi these are many programmes in which famous singers \\nare invited to sing nazams or Ghazals written by famous poets like Ghalib, Maum, Bulley \\nShah, Waris Shah besides many others. So you can imagine how rich our language and \\nliterary culture must have been to continue till today. It has enriched our lives and is central to \\npeople meeting and intermingling with each other. Among the best prose writers were people \\nlike Pandit Ratan Nath Sarshar, who wrote the famous Fasanah - i-Azad. Even in the early \\ndays, Munshi Prem Chand, who is supposed to be a doyen of Hindi literature, wrote in Urdu. \\nUrdu has given us a new form of poem that is called a nazm. Urdu was patronised by the \\nNawabs of Lucknow, who held symposiums in this language. Slowly it became quite popular. \\nPakistan has adopted Urdu as the state language.', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Development of Literature during the Mughal Period  \\nThere was a tremendous development in the field of literature during the Mughal times. \\nBabar and Humauan were lovers of literature. Baber was himself a great scholar of Persian. \\nHe wrote a book known as Tuzek -e-Babari which is highly esteemed by the Turkish \\nLiterature. Humayun got the treatise translated into Arabic. He too was a lover of learning \\nand had establihsed a big Library. Humayun Nama, tops the books written in his times. Akbar \\nwas very fond of leaning. ‘Akbar Nama’, Sur Sagar, Ram Charitamanas are prominent among \\nthe books written during his time. Malik Muhammad Jayasis Padmavat and Keshav’s Ram \\nChandrika were also written during the same period. Jahangir greatly patronized literature. \\nMany scholars adorned his court. He too was a scholar of a high caliber and wrote his life \\nstory. During Shah Jahan’s time there was a well known scholar named Abdul Hameed \\nLahori. He wrote Badshah Nama. The literary activities suffered during Aurangzeb’ s \\ntime.Urdu literature started developing during the last days of the Mughal emperor. This \\ncredit goes to Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan and Mirza Galib. The language of Sir Sayyid Ahmed \\nKhan was very simple and impressive. His compositions inspired the other urdu writer Mirza \\nGalib, who was a famous poet of his time. He made an important contribution to uplift Urdu \\npoetry. There were some other writers also who took interest in Urdu poetry and enriched the \\nUrdu literature. Maulvi Altab Hussain Ali, Akbar Allahabadi and Dr. Mohammed Iqbal are \\nsome famous names. As Persian was the language of the court, much of the literature \\nproduced in this period was written in Persian. Amir Khusrau and Amir Hasan Dehelvi wrote \\nsuperb poetry in Persian. Historians like Minhas -us-Siraj and Zia Barani and Ibn Batuta who \\ncame to India during those days wrote accounts of rulers, important political events and \\nincidents in this language. In the medieval period, Persian was adopted as the court language. \\nSeveral historical accounts, administrative manuals and allied literature in this language have \\ncome down to us. The mughal rulers were great patrons of leaning and literature. Babar wrote \\nhis tuzuk (autobiography) in Turkish language, but his grandson Akbar got it translated into \\nPersian. Akbar patronized many scholars. He got Mahabharata translated into Persian. \\nJahangir’s autobiography (Tuzuk -i-Jahangiri) is in Persian and is a unique piece of literature. \\nIt is said that Noorjahan was an accomplished Persian poetess. Quite a fair amount of Persian \\nliterature has been produced by the courtiers of the Mughals. Abul Fazl’s Akbarnamah and \\nAin-e-Akbari is a fine piece of literature. From there we get a good deal of information about \\nAkbar and his times. Faizi wrote beautiful Persian poetry. Several collections of letters of the \\nMughal period (insha) have come down to us. Besides shedding light on Mughal history, they', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

Similarly, we have a work named Tabqa t-i-\\nAlamgïri, shedding light on Aurangzeb. Badauni was another writer who belonged during \\nAkbar’s time. In the twentieth century, Iqbal wrote good Persian poetry. All this has now \\nbecome a part of Indian heritage and culture. Among the noted Hindu poets of this period \\nwere Kabir, Tulsidas, Surdas and Rahim. Kabirs dohas are still so popular today while \\nTulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas has become the most sacred book of the Hindus. Behari’s Satsai \\nwritten during Akbar’s reign is very famous. Alankarashekhara by Keshav Mishra was \\nproduced in Akbar’s court. It was a great Sanskrit work on the styles of writing. Akbar also \\ngot many Sanskrit books like Bhagwad Gita and Upanishads translated into Persian.  \\nHINDI LITERATURE  \\nThese was a tremendous growth of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, \\nMarathi and Gujarati during this time. In the South, Malayalam emerged as an independent \\nlanguage in the 14th century The emergence of all these languages resulted in the decline of \\nSanskrit as they came to be used as the medium through which the administrative machinery \\nfunctioned. The rise of the Bhakti movement and the use of these regional langages by the \\nvarious saints helped in their growth and development. We have already noted the various \\ndialects that developed in northern and western India. Prithviraj Raso is supposed to be the \\nfirst book in the Hindi language. It is an account of exploits of Prithviraj Chauhan. In its \\nimitation several other rasos were written. The language went on changing as the area whe re \\nit was used expanded. New words to express new situations were either coined or taken from \\nareas coming under its influence. Hindi literature looked to Sanskrit classics for guidance and \\nBharata’s Natyashastra was kept in mind by Hindi writers. During the twelfth and thirteenth \\ncenturies there started a movement in southern India that was called the Bhakti movement. As \\nits influence reached the north, it started affecting the prose and poetry that were bein g \\ncomposed in Hindi. Poetry now became largely devotional in nature.Some of the poets like \\nTuisidas wrote poetry in a language which was of that region only, while others like Kabir, \\nwho moved from place to place added Persian and Urdu words as well. Though it is said that \\nTuisidas wrote Ramcharit Manas based on Valmiki’s Ramayana, he also alters situations and \\nadds quite a few new scenes and situations based on folklore. For example, Sita’s exile is \\nmentioned in Valmiki’s version but it is not mentioned in Tulsidas’s account. Tuisidas has \\ndeified his hero while the hero of Valmiki is a human being.Hindi evolved during the \\nApabhramsa stage between the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. and the 14th C.

The most famous \\nfigures from this period were Kabir and Tulsidas.In modern times, the Khadi dialect became \\nmore prominent and a variety of literature was produced in Sanskrit. Similarly, Surdas wrote \\nhis Sur Sagar in which he talks of Krishna as an infant, a young lad indulging in pranks and a  \\nyoung man engaged in dalliance with the gopis. These poets made a deep impression on the \\nminds of the listeners. If the festivals associated with Rama and Krishna have become so very \\npopular, the credit goes to these poets. Their versions became the source of inspiration not \\nonly for other poets but also for painters in the medieval ages. They inspired Mirabai, who \\nsang in Rajasthani language, and Raskhan, who, though a Muslim, sang in praise of Krishna. \\nNandadasa was an important Bhakti poet. Rahim and Bhushan were a class apart. Their \\nsubject was not devotion, but spiritual. Bihari wrote his Satsai in the seventeenth century; it \\ngives us a glimpse of shringar(love) and other rasas. All the above -mentioned Hindi poets, \\nexcept Kabir, expressed their sentiments essentially to satisfy their own devotional instincts. \\nKabir did not believe in institutionalised religion. He was a devotee of a formless God. \\nChanting His name was the be -all and end -all for him. All these poets influenced the north \\nIndian society in a manner that had never happened earlier. As it is easier to remember poetry \\nthan prose, they became immensely popular. During the last 150 years, many writers have \\ncontributed to the development of modern India literature, written in a number of regional \\nlanguages as well as in English. One of the greatest Bengali writers, Rabindranath Tagore \\nbecame the first Indian to win the Nobel Prize for literature (Geetanjali) in 1913. However, it \\nis only with the beginning of nineteenth century that -Hindi prose came into its own. \\nBharatendu Harishchandra was one of the earliest to produce dramas in Hindi which were \\nbasically translations of texts written in Sanskrit and other languages. But he set the trend. \\nMahavir Prasad Dwivedi was another author who wrote translations or made adaptations \\nfrom Sanskrit. Bankim Chandra Chatterji (l 838 -94) wrote novels originally in Bangla. They \\ncame to be translated into Hindi and became very popular. Vande Mataram, our national \\nsong, is an excerpt from his novel, Anand Math. Swami Dayanand’s contribution to Hindi \\ncannot be ignored. Originally a Gujarati and a scholar of Sanskrit, he advocated Hindi as a \\ncommon language for the whole of India. He started writing in Hindi and contributed articles \\nto journals essentially engaged in religious and social reforms. SatyarthaPrakash was his most \\nimportant work in Hindi. Among other names who have enriched Hindi literature, is that of \\nMunshi Prem Chand, who switched over from Urdu to Hindi.

The main writers of this period were Sadasukh Lal and Enshallah Khan. Bhartendu \\nHarishchandra also strengthened Hindi language. Similarly Raja Lakshman Singh translated \\nShakuntala into Hindi.

Similarly, Prem Chand, Vrindavan lal Verma \\nand Ellachandra Joshi wrote novels and enriched Hindi literature.  \\nIf we look at the above writers, we find that they all wrote with a purpose.

Munshi \\nPrem Chand tried to draw the attention of the society to the miserable existence of the poor \\nand Mahadevi Verma recipient of Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award \\nhighlighted the conditions of women in the society. ‘Nirala’ became the pioneer of awakening \\nof Modern India.  \\nBENGALI, ASSAMESE AND ORIYA LITERATURE  \\nAfter Hindi, the next significant literature was the one that developed in Bengal. The Baptist \\nMission Press was established in Serampore near Calcutta in 1800. East India Company \\nfounded the Fort William College in the same year. It provided training to civil servants of \\nthe Company in law, customs, religions, languages and literatures of India to enable them to \\nwork more efficiently.The growth of the Bhakti movement and the compositon of various \\nhymns associated with Chaitanya provided a stimulus to the development and growth of \\nBengali. Narrative poems called the Mangal Kavyas also grew popular during this period. \\nThey propatated the worship of local deities like Chandi and transformed Puranic Gods like \\nSiva and Vishnu into household deities.In this regard, a very important landmark was \\nachieved by William Carey, who wrote a grammar of Bengali and published an English -', metadata={'source': '7_merged.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

It may be noted that the \\ngrammar and dictionaries are important in the development of a literature. They guide the \\nwriters as to the correctness of a sentence and also help them in finding suitable words for a \\nparticular situation and idea.Although the aim of the press run by the missionaries was \\nmainly to propagate Christian faith but other presses run by local people helped in the \\nflourishing of non -Christian literature.Scores of pamphlets, small and big books and journals \\nwere produced. In the meantime education spread, although at a very slow pace. But after \\n1835, when Macaulay won the battle against Orientalists, it spread at a faster pace. In 1854 \\ncame Sir Charles Wood’s Despatch and in 1857 the three universities of Calcutta, Madras and \\nBombay were established. Besides textbooks for schools and colleges, other literature were \\nalso produced. However it was Raja Ram Mohan Roy who wrote in Bengali besides English \\nthat gave impetus to Bengali literature. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820 -91) and Akshay \\nKumar Dutta (1820 - 86) were two other writers of this early period.In addition to these, \\nBankim Chandra Chatterji (l834 -94), Sharat Chandra Chatterji (l876 -1938), and R.C. Dutta, a \\nnoted historian and a prose writer, all contributed to the making of Bengali literature. But the \\nmost important name that influenced the whole of India was that of Rabindra Nath Tagore \\n(1861 -1941). Novels, dramas, short stories, criticism, music and essays, all flowed from his \\npen. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1913 for his Geetanjali.However, a few things \\nneed to be noted about the influence of Western ideas which permeated Bengal and later on \\nother parts of India. Upto 1800, most of the literature produced was limited to religion or \\ncourtly literature. The Western influence brought the writers closer to the man in the street. \\nThe subjects were mundane. Some religious literature was also produced but it hardly said \\nanything new.The final years of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth \\ncentury saw a new subject, nationalism, being taken up. Two things were seen in this new \\ntrend. The first was the love for old history and culture and an awareness of the facts of \\nBritish exploitation. The second was a clarion call for arousing the Indians to drive out the \\nforeigners, both by persuasion and force. This new trend was expressed by Subrahmanyam \\nBharti in Tamil and Qazi Nazrul Islam in Bengali.The contributions of these two writers in \\narousing the nationalistic sentiments in the readers was tremendous. Their poetry was \\ntranslated into other Indian languages.Assamese - Like Bengali, Assamese also developed in \\nresponse to the Bhakti movement. Shankardeva who introduced Vaishnavism in Assam \\nhelped in the growth of Assamese poetry. Even the Puranas were translated in Assamese.The \\nearliest Assamese literature consisted of buranjis (court chronicles).

From Orissa, a couple of \\nnames are worth mentioning and these are Fakirmohan Senapati and Radha Nath Ray, whose \\nwritings deserve considerable attention in the history of Oriya literature.The works of \\nUpendra Bhanja (1670 - 1720) were important as they ushered a new period of Oriya \\nliterature. In Orissa the works of Saraladasa are regarded as the first works of Oriya literature.  \\nPUNJABI AND RAJASTHANI LITERATURE  \\nPunjabi is a language with several shades. It is being written in two scripts, Gurmukhi and \\nPersian. The Gurmukhi script till the end of the nineteenth century was almost limited to the \\nAdi Granth, the holy book of the Sikhs. Only a small number of people tried to learn the \\nscript except the granthis, who recited the holy Granth in the gurdwaras. However, the \\nlanguage did not lack literature. Guru Nanak was the first poet in Punjabi. Some other \\ncontemporary poets, mostly Sufi saints, used to sing in this language. These Sufis or their \\nfollowers used the Persian script if they wanted to commit their poetry to writing. In this list, \\nthe first name is that of Farid.  \\nHis poetry has found a place in the Adi Granth. The Adi Granth also contains poetry of the \\nnext four gurus. All this literature belongs to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Amongst \\nthe later gurus, the poetry of the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur has also contributed to the \\nAdi Granth. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth guru, was educated in Patna (Bihar), where he \\nlearnt Persian and Sanskrit. He has composed two savaiyyas in Punjabi but these are not a \\npart of the Adi Granth.But it was the love stories of Heer and Ranjha, Sasi and Punnu and \\nSohni and Mahiwal, which gave this language its theme in the early days. Even the story of \\nPuran Bhagat found favour with some poets. Beautiful poems written by some known and \\nsome unknown poets have come down to us. These are being sung by local singers for the \\nlast two or three hundred years. There are several other poetic stories which have been \\ncomposed by the locals. This folklore has been preserved. The most important of these is \\nHeer of Waris Shah. It is the most popular of the early works. It is a landmark in Punjabi \\npoetry. Similar is the popularity of Bulley Shah who was a Sufi saint. He has left a large \\nnumber of songs. One of his popular forms of compositions was called kafi; it was sung in a \\nclassical musical form. Kafis are sung by people with great fervour.In the twentieth century, \\nPunjabi had come into its own.

The bards (itinerant singers) \\nmoved from place to place, providing entertainment and keeping the stories of heroes alive. It \\nwas from these ballads that Colonel Todd collected the heroic stories of Rajasthan and put \\nthem in the Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan. But the devotional songs of Mira Bai have a \\nplace of pride in the history of language as well as devotional music. Mira Bai’s love for he r \\nlord (Lord Krishna) is sometimes so intense that it transcends this mundane world and \\ntransports one to the land of this singer.The development of the Bhakti movement led to the \\nrise of the different regional languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Kannada, Tamil \\nand Telugu.  \\nGUJARATI LITERATURE  \\nEarly Gujarati literature is available in the form of Bhakti songs of the fourteenth and \\nfifteenth centuries. It still follows the old tradition which is popular in Gujarat. Narsi Mehta’ s \\nname is the foremost in this respect. The people of Gujarat wove these devotional songs in \\ntheir folk dances and their religious forms often find expressions in their celebrations. \\nNarmad’s poetry gave a fillip to the Gujarati literature. Saraswati Chandra, a novel by \\nGovardhan Ram, has become a classic and has given great impetus to other writers. But \\nprobably a name that cannot be forgotten is that of Dr. K.M. Munshi. He was a novelist, an \\nessayist and a historian, and has left a plethora of historical novels. In these books he exhibits \\nhis ability to mix fact with fiction. Prithvi Vallabha is one of his finest novels. A special \\nmention must be made of Narsi Mehta whose songs in praise of Krishna not only made him a \\nvery popular figure but also made Gujarati language popular.  \\nSINDHI LITERATURE  \\nSindh was one of the important centres of Sufis, who established khanqahs at various places. \\nThe Sufi singers with their devotional music made the language popular. The credit for \\ncreating literature in Sindhi goes to Mirza Kalish Beg and Dewan Kauramal.  \\nMARATHI LITERATURE  \\nMaharashtra is situated on a plateau where a large number of local dialects were in use. \\nMarathi grew out of these these local dialects. The Portuguese missionaries started using \\nMarathi for preaching their gospel.The earliest Marathi poetry and prose is by Saint \\nJnaneshwar (Gyaneshwar) who lived in the thirteenth century.

His songs \\nare very popular all over Maharashtra.Then came Tukarama (1598 -1650). He is supposed to \\nbe the greatest Bhakti poet of them all. Ramdas (1608 -81), who was the guru of Shivaji, is the \\nlast of these hymn writers. He was the devotee of Rama. He inspired Shivaji. The closing \\nyears of the nineteenth century saw an upsurge in the Marathi literature. It was a nationalist \\nmovement that made Marathi prose popular and prominent. Bal Gangadhar Tilak (l 857 -\\n1920) started his Journal Kesari in Marathi. This helped the growth of Marathi literature. But \\nthe role of Keshav Sut and V .S. Chiplunkar was no less. Hari Narayan Apte and Agarkar \\nwrote novels which became very popular. All these prose writers made great contribution to \\nthe development of Marathi literature. The name of H.G Salgaokar is remembered for writing \\ninspirational poetry. Besides, the names of M.G. Ranade, K.T. Telang, G.T. Madholkar (poet \\nand novelist) are no less important.  \\nKASHMIRI LITERATURE  \\nKashmir shot into literary prominence, when Kalhana wrote Rajatarangini in Sanskrit But \\nthis was in the language of the elite. For locals, Kashmiri was the popular dialect. Here also \\nthe Bhakti movement played its role. One Lal Ded, who lived in the fourteenth century, was \\nprobably the first to sing in the Kashmiri language. She was a Shaivite mystic. After Islam \\nspread in this area, the Sufi influence also came to be visible. Haba Khatoon, Mahjoor, Zinda \\nKaul, Noor Din also known as Nund Rishi, Akhtar Mohiuddin, Sufi Ghulam Mohammad and \\nDina Nath Nadim wrote devotional poetry in Kashmiri. These people contributed to the \\ngrowth of Kashmiri literature.The Western influence did not reach Kashmir till the end of the \\nnineteenth century. In 1846, after the first Sikh War, the Dogras of Jammu became the rulers \\nthere. The Dogras were more interested in Dogri language than in Kashmiri. There were \\nhardly any schools or education. There was widespread poverty and economic backwardness. \\nAll these led to a lack of good literature in Kashmir.Though the list of Modern Indian \\nlanguages can have many languages, the constitution of India has originally about 15 \\nlanguages as national languages i.e. Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Marathi, \\nOriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam.
